# Quickstart

Source codes for all apps in Supervisely Ecosystem are publicly [available](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/repository). You can use any app as a template for your app. In this tutorial we are going to use prepared app [template](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/app-template-headless).  

This app just prints progress bar (to console and to Supervisely) from 1 to 10 and sleeps 1 sec on each iteration. 

See video how app works:
