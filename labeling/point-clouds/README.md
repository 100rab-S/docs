3D Annotation module is a web application that runs in your browser with the help of javascript and can be accessed from anywhere. 

## Pre-Requirements

Follow those recommendations for the best results:

{% hint style="info" %}
Though we support all common web browsers, we strongly recommend using **Google Chrome** or **Mozilla Firefox**, because we use latest technologies to render annotations and the scene. We also advise you to use the latest version of your web browser.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
To work with 3D annotation we recommend to use computer with hardware acceleration available. Check if your browser uses hardware acceleration [here](chrome://gpu) or 
{% endhint %}

## Getting Started

3D Annotation module supports working with only one `Dataset` at once.

To start annotation you should open a `Project` and click on the relevant `Dataset` from the [dashboard](../../data-organization/projects.md).
